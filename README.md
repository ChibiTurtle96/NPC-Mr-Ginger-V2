# Mr-Ginger-NPC-V2
V2 of my Stardew Valley mod. 
This contains the regular (released on Nexus) mod, plus the following additional features:
- Mr Ginger becomes datable after 6 hearts.
- You can dance with him at the flower dance.
- You can date and "marry" the char (the ceremony dialogue has been changed to make it a little less weird).
- At 14-hearts, the truth about Mr Ginger is revealed. This is configurable and can be toggled on and off if you don't like it - or just feel like seeing ALL the heart scenes!
- new 10 heart scene. Old 10-heart scene has been moved to configured 14-heart slot.
- additional dialogue from other chars.

Required to run it:
- Content Patcher
- TMXL

Useful but not compulsory:
- Miss Coriel's Unique Courtship Dialogue (makes bouquet acceptance less weird).
- Pregnancy roles (to remove any oddness that might ensue if you are a female farmer married to Mr Ginger).

To run it: unzip the file into your SDV "Mods" folder.
